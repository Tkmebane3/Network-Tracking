# Network-Tracking
This program offers a simple, structured way to log meaningful contacts in your personal or professional network. It helps users remember names, events, job titles, and shared interests from in-person meetings.

Unlike social platforms like LinkedIn, this tool is built for quick, personal record-keeping — ideal for those who attend events, conferences, or meet new people often.

Upon running the program:

A .txt file is created in the same folder as the Python script (if one doesn’t already exist).

Any previously saved contacts are displayed automatically.

The user is prompted to add a new contact if desired.

The program collects key information through prompts (Name, Where You Met, Job Title, Shared Interests).

The contact is stored in the file in a clean, readable format for future viewing.

Recommended for anyone actively networking who prefers a private, personal system for remembering real-life interactions.
